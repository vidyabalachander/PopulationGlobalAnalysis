    "1) How does life expectancy correlate with healthcare spending, sanitation, and income?\n",
    " - This question looks into the factors of life expectancy and if nations that spend more money on healthcare per capita, have higher sanitation levels, and have higher incomes have higher life expectancies.\n",
    "2) Are countries with rapidly aging populations experiencing slower economic growth?\n",
    " - Does a higher old-age dependency ratio correlate with lower GDP growth?\n",
    "3) Is there a connection between gender inequality index and life expectancy disparity between men and women?\n",
    " - Do countries with higher gender inequality have a greater gap in life expectancy between genders?\n"

    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "I’ve always been interested in geography and population demographics ever since I took AP Human Geography in high school. Also, I’ve always wondered what factors influence the wide range of life expectancies in different countries. Is it related to economics, education levels, healthcare spending or something else? Maybe a combination of all three? Also, as a woman I’m interested in looking at the relationship between gender inequality and the gap between male and female life expectancies since I know that women live longer on average, but I want to see how that is affected by inequality."

    "## Data Setting\n",
    "\n",
    "I will be using the World Development Indicators dataset from the World Bank. It has over 1,600 indicators and represents 266 countries over decades making it an incredibly comprehensive demographic dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of some of the indicators I will use:\n",
    "- Female employment rate (%)\n",
    "- GDP per capita (current USD)\n",
    "- Life expectancy at birth (years)\n",
    "- Current health expenditure (% of GDP per capita)\n",
    "- Education expenditure (% of GDP)\n",
    "\n",
    "Some potential complications of this dataset are:\n",
    " - Datapoints are missing for some countries during some years\n",
    " - Countries may have different methods of data collection which may lead to some inconsistencies.\n",
    " - Some of these factors might affect each other but have non-linear relationship which may make it difficult to analyze data"
